# Title
Steel Defect Detection - Kaggle Competition hosted by Severstal Group

# Purpose
This project aims at helping engineers improve the algorithm by localizing and classifying surface defects on a steel sheet.

# Highlights
- Developed an integrated classification and segmentation model using Tensorflow to improve the accuracy and efficiency in detecting and categorizing surface defects on steel sheets. 
- Engineered a classification module to identify defective samples and a segmentation module to localize and classify defects.
- Utilized a range of models including Sequential, DenseNet, and VGG-16 for classification tasks. Implemented the U-Net base model and employed techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation to elevate segmentation performance.
- Conducted extensive training and evaluation of each model to determine the optimal approach for the task.
- Achieved a competitive score of 0.85 on Kaggle, with test metrics of 0.0215 test loss and a test Dice coefficient of 0.6148
